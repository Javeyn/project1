# Food AI

## Project created by Henry Lin, Paolo Torrado, and Jack Sorensen

### Food AI is an application developed in 2019. It allows users to take a picture of a food item, and then reference it through a smart learning API to tell you what your food consists of from a glance.

### Looking to the future of computer science and web developement, we wanted to go with an ambitious project that captures the flavor of the day, and in this case it would be AI/VI/Machine Learning.
